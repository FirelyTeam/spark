Forge is the official HL7 FHIR profile editor. Tailoring the FHIR specification to a specific use-case is an important aspect of the FHIR standard. This process is also known as profiling. While the FHIR spec targets all countries and all use cases, profiling allows you to define local use of FHIR.
